# “Bloodgate Exorcism” - meat_chuma

Map for Quake mod “Quoth”, intended for Quake event “meat jam”

### Author info

- Map name : Bloodgate Exorcism.
- Mod: Quoth (fixed 1.2.2 fgd).
- Author : Chuma.
### General Information

This map was made by me in order to distract my mind, not fond initially of the meat jam but i decided to make a small project, move over all to try out Quoth… this map has not much around it, i went to make it as simplistic as i could… Most of the map is focused on the use of trigger_monsterjumps and i think i did a fairly good practice on it.

Also i differed from the select your path and go for the key formula in this one, to make it short, cut testing time and focus in making a short, fun map… The name came from the song used from White bat / Karl Casey : “Exorcism”, I wanted to make a tech map for a bit as a practice and i mixed it with the gory theme… Bloodgate Exorcism was born, hope you enjoy this one people! Excelsior!
